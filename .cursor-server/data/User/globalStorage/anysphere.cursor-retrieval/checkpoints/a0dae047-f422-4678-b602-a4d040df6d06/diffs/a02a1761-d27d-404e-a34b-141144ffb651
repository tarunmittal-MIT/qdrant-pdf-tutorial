SENTENCE-BASED CHUNKING (Recommended for PDFs):","   ✓ Preserves context and meaning","   ✓ Better semantic understanding","   ✓ Ideal for documents with natural language","   ✓ Use 2-5 sentences per chunk with 1 sentence overlap","","2. PARAGRAPH-BASED CHUNKING:","   ✓ Maintains document structure","   ✓ Good for technical documents","   ✓ Respects natural breaks in content","   ✓ Use 500-1000 characters per chunk","","3. TOKEN-BASED CHUNKING:","   ✓ Respects model token limits","   ✓ Good for embedding models with constraints","   ✓ More precise size control","   ✓ Use 256-512 tokens per chunk","","🔧 QDRANT CONFIGURATION:","","1. DISTANCE METRICS:","   - COSINE: Best for semantic similarity (recommended)","   - EUCLIDEAN: Good for L2 distance","   - DOT: For normalized vectors","","2. VECTOR SIZE:","   - all-MiniLM-L6-v2: 384 dimensions (fast, good quality)","   - all-mpnet-base-v2: 768 dimensions (better quality)","   - BGE models: 768+ dimensions (state-of-the-art)","","3. STORAGE OPTIONS:","   - In-memory: Fast, but data lost on restart","   - Local storage: Persistent, good for development","   - Qdrant Cloud: Production-ready, scalable","","📊 DATA SPLITTING:","","1. INDEXING VS QUERY SET:","   - 80-90% for indexing (chunks to search over)","   - 10-20% for queries (test queries)","","2. VALIDATION:","   - Keep test queries separate","   - Don't peek at test set!","   - Use for evaluation metrics","","🎯 OPTIMIZATION TIPS:","","1. CHUNK SIZE:","   - Too small: May lose context","   - Too large: May include irrelevant info","   - Sweet spot: 200-500 tokens","","2. OVERLAP:","   - 10-20% overlap maintains context","   - Prevents information loss at boundaries","   - Improves retrieval quality","","3. METADATA:","   - Store page numbers, sections, source info","   - Enables filtered searches","   - Helps with result interpretation","","4.
